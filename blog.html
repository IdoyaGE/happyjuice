        <img src="image/bottles.jpg" alt="Bottles of juice">
        <p>If you’d like to reset your body, why not try a juice cleanse?</p>
        <p>Our 2-day and 4-day cleanses are the perfect way to get started.</p>
        <p>To ensure optimal results before hitting “go” on that cleanse button, paying attention to your physical and mental wellbeing is important.</p>
        <h3><b>Look after your body</b></h3>
        <p>The best way to prepare for a cleanse is to adopt healthy eating habits and ease yourself into the cleanse.</p> 
        <p>It’s no good one day feasting on pizza or any other junk food and then starting a cleanse the next.</p>
        <p>Instead, cut out processed foods for a few days beforehand and concentrate on fresh fruit, vegetables, seeds, nuts and good-quality protein.
        <p>When embarking on this journey, consider avoiding high-intensity exercises like cardio or weight lifting while cleansing.</p> 
        <p>Try yoga or simple stretching exercises instead.</p>
        <h3>Look after your mind</h3>
        <p>Our minds are powerful and deserve care! As you embark on your cleanse journey, take some extra time out for yourself.</p>
        <p>Pamper your mind with a few moments of meditation or mindful reflection, it’ll be worth the effort to get the full benefits from this amazing experience.</p>

        <h2>THE POWER OF GREEN JUICE</h2>
        <img src="image/greenjuice.jpg" alt="A bottle of green juice with vegetables and fruits">
        <p>"Green juice" isn't a specific type of juice; it's a broad term that applies to any juice that's green and/or contains green vegetables.</p> 
        <p>The ingredients don't all have to be green, but generally, the end result is a juice that's at least greenish in color.</p>
        <p>Leafy greens, which are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients, are essential to maximizing the nutritional value of your green juice.</p> 
        <p>They're also rich in chlorophyll, the compound that puts the "green" in green juice.</p> 
        <p>Chlorophyll not only gives greens their color, but it's also a powerful antioxidant and can help support your body's natural detoxification pathways.</p>
        <p>The darker the green vegetable, the more chlorophyll it contains.</p>
        <p>The specific benefits you'll get from your green juice depend on what's in it, but here are some general health perks that apply across the board:</p>
        <p><b>1.A major source of nutrients:</b>Green juice is a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals, because they're already in liquid form (instead of in a whole food matrix), those beneficial nutrients are generally easier to digest and absorb</p>
        <p><b>2.Supports your gut health:</b>Green juice is also a gut health superstar. "Green juices can provide essential phytonutrients like flavonoids and antioxidants to support microbial diversity and gut health</p>
        <p><b>3.Promotes hydration:</b>Green juice can help keep you hydrated, especially if it contains high-water content veggies like cucumbers. Cucumbers are 90% water2 and loaded with electrolytes like magnesium and potassium, which help maintain optimal fluid balance in your cells.</p>
        <P>But make sure you're drinking plenty of water, too.</P>
